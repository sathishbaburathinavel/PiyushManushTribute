    <p>‘Green’ ventures are Coop’s USP. Anybody can visit it, stay in the pristine environment and learn about bee-keeping, mushroom cultivation, bio-gas generation…there are 30 such ventures to choose from. Writer M. Harikrishnan’s Kalari Trust is setting up a school for koothu in its premises. Piyush also plans to organize educational camps for school children there.</p>

  <div class="row">
	<div class="col-xs-12">
	<p> An enthusiastic bunch of people and plenty of hard work — this is what it took to create a bird sanctuary on a lakebed in Tamil Nadu. At 6 a.m. every Sunday, for seven consecutive months, about 150 men, women, and children gathered at the polluted Mookaneri Lake in Salem. Excavators were employed to dig out soil from the 58-acre lake and heap it to form islands on the surface.<strong> A Nature lover spotted 42 bird species there in two hours.</strong></p>
